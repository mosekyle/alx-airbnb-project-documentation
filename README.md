## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


---

## Project Tasks

### 1. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities
- **Objective:** Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend.
- **Instructions:**
  - Use **Draw.io** to create a detailed document listing backend features such as:
    - User Authentication
    - Property Management
    - Booking System
    - Payments
  - Export the design as a PNG file.
- **Output:** A PNG file documenting all backend features.
- **Location:** [`features-and-functionalities/features-and-functionalities.png`](features-and-functionalities/features-and-functionalities.png)

---

### 2. Use Case Diagram
- **Objective:** Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.
- **Instructions:**
  - Based on the documented features, use **Draw.io** to create a use case diagram showing interactions between users and the system for functionalities like:
    - User Registration
    - Property Booking
    - Payments
  - Export the diagram as a PNG file.
- **Output:** A PNG file visualizing user-system interactions.
- **Location:** [`use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png`](use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png)

---

### 3. User Stories
- **Objective:** Convert use case diagram interactions into user stories.
- **Instructions:**
  - Translate use case interactions into user stories. Example:
    - ‚ÄúAs a user, I want to register an account so that I can list my properties.‚Äù
  - Document at least 5 core user stories.
  - Save them in a Markdown file.
- **Output:** A Markdown file containing user stories.
- **Location:** [`user-stories/user-stories.md`](user-stories/user-stories.md)

---

### 4. Data Flow Diagram
- **Objective:** Design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.
- **Instructions:**
  - Use **Draw.io** to design a DFD illustrating:
    - Data inputs
    - Processes
    - Outputs for backend operations like bookings and payments.
  - Export the DFD as a PNG file.
- **Output:** A PNG file illustrating data flow within the system.
- **Location:** [`data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png`](data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png)

---

### 5. System Flowchart
- **Objective:** Visualize a key backend process using a flowchart.
- **Instructions:**
  - Choose a process (e.g., user registration or property booking) and map its workflow using **Draw.io**.
  - Export the flowchart as a PNG file.
- **Output:** A PNG file visualizing a backend workflow.
- **Location:** [`flowcharts/flowchart.png`](flowcharts/flowchart.png)

---

### 6. Requirement Specifications
- **Objective:** Write detailed technical and functional requirements for backend features.
- **Instructions:**
  - Document the requirements for features like:
    - User Authentication
    - Property Management
    - Booking System
  - Include:
    - API endpoints
    - Input/output specifications
    - Validation rules
    - Performance criteria
  - Save the document in the root directory.
- **Output:** A Markdown file containing detailed requirement specifications.
- **Location:** [`requirements.md`](requirements.md)

---

## Tools Used
- **[Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/):** For creating diagrams.
- **Markdown:** For user stories and requirements documentation.
- **GitHub:** For version control and repository management.
